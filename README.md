# Sobhan's Dotfiles (Linux)

You can install dotfiles by cloning the repository as `.dotfiles` in your home directory and running the bootstrap script.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:50bhan/dotfiles.git .dotfiles

$ cd .dotfiles

$ ./bootstrap.sh
```

As an alternative, you can download `downloader.sh` script and just run it. It will clone the repository in your home directory, and then run bootstrap script for you.

```
$ ./downloader.sh
```
